# ArlingtonTrees
DataKindDC project with EcoAction Arlington, through their 
[Tree Canopy Fund](https://www.ecoactionarlington.org/community-programs/trees/). The goal is to determine which 
neighborhoods to focus on when advertising that EcoAction can provide and plant
 trees for free. The intent is to find areas that have low tree-canopy and are 
 lower-income.

The majority of the documentation and all of the data is stored in Google Drive. 
Please reach out to [DataKindDC](https://www.datakind.org/chapters/datakind-dc) 
to join the project!
